We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 0.13](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-ec2/releases).


Here is examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
### Basic Example
```hcl
    module "ec2" {
      source                      = "clouddrove/ec2/aws"
      version                     = "0.13.0"
      application                 = "clouddrove"
      environment                 = "test"
      label_order                 = ["environment", "application", "name"]
      instance_count              = 2
      ami                         = "ami-08d658f84a6d84a80"

      monitoring                  = false
      tenancy                     = "default"
      vpc_security_group_ids_list = [module.ssh.security_group_ids, module.http-https.security_group_ids]
      subnet_ids                  = tolist(module.public_subnets.public_subnet_id)
      assign_eip_address          = true
      associate_public_ip_address = true
      instance_profile_enabled    = true
      iam_instance_profile        = module.iam-role.name

## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
